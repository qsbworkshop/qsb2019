My aim is to develop a predictive mathematical model of the human in vivo CD8+ T cell response in order to prevent and alleviate viral infection. My initial training was in theoretical physics. I have a BSc in Physics (1st class hons. University College London), an MSc in Mathematics (distinction, Imperial College London) and a PhD in Theoretical Particle Physics (title: "Non Commutative Geometry", University of Durham). I then worked as a mathematical modeller for the UK government for 2 years before crossing disciplines to Mathematical Immunology. I held a Wellcome Trust Fellowship at Imperial College London and then a Leverhulme Trust Fellowship at the University of Oxford before returning to Imperial as a lecturer.

I completed my undergraduate and postgraduate training at the University of Oxford, first obtaining a Masters in Mathematics, followed by a DPhil in Computational Biology from the Department of Computer Science. My research sits at the interface between mathematics, computer science and biology. More specifically, I focus on the concept of biology as computation, in which the biochemistry of the cell performs information processing in the service of decision-making. Towards this, I collaborate with experimentalists at the Universities of Cambridge and Padova to investigate stem cell decision-making throughout Development. As a computational scientist in biology, my goal is to identify the necessary abstractions to develop predictive, explanatory models of the biological programs that govern cellular behaviour. Ultimately, this research will lead us to make cells programmable, which could fundamentally transform medicine, agriculture and even the ways we generate energy.

Patrick Kemmeren obtained his PhD in 2005 from Utrecht University for his work on analyzing and integrating genome-scale data. A postdoctoral fellowship obtained through EMBO and the Netherlands Genomics Initiative (NGI) allowed him to work at the University of California, San Francisco. Under the supervision of Dr. Nevan Krogan, he worked on the definition of an accurate and comprehensive map of stable protein-protein interactions. After returning to University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC Utrecht), he obtained a VENI grant from the Dutch Science Foundation (NWO) in 2007. After starting his own research group, Patrick received an NWO VIDI award in 2012 to investigate further the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic interactions. In 2013, Patrick became an Assistant Professor at the Center for Molecular Medicine, UMC Utrecht. In addition to these research activities, Patrick has been the coordinator of the High-Performance Computing facility for Life Sciences at Utrecht Science Park between 2012 and 2017, executive committee member of the Utrecht Bioinformatics Center since 2014 and board member of the Netherlands Bioinformatics and Systems Biology research school since 2017. Patrick joined the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology as a group leader in 2016.  </p>

She is currently a Junior Group Leader in the Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy at UCL. Andela uses computer simulations to study biological assembly. She is interested in how proteins assemble “on-demand” into nanososcale structures that generate the molecular machinery of life. She is also devoted to understanding uncontrolled protein aggregation in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.

<p>
     <img src="/qsb2019/images/Tang.jpg" style="float:Left;width:140px;padding-right:10px;" /><b>Biography: </b>T-Y Dora Tang received her PhD from Imperial College London, UK, in 2010 in the area of membrane biophysics. After 1 year as an EPSRC knowledge transfer secondee at Diamond Light Source, Oxfordshire, UK she undertook a post-doc at the University of Bristol, UK, in the areas of origin of life and then synthetic biology. In 2016 she started her independent lab at the MPI-CBG, Dresden as part of the MaxSynBio consortium. Her research lies between biophysics, synthetic biology and materials chemistry with the goal of building minimal synthetic cellular systems as physical models for biological phenomena specifically those related to compartmentalisation. These minimal systems aim to address questions in origin of life and in modern biology  such as “what are the conditions required to drive molecular organisation from disorder?”
